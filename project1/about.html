        <h1>The Merdi Grars Festival</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Mardi Gras refers to events of the Carnival celebration, beginning on or after the Christian feasts of
            the Epiphany (Three Kings Day) and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday, which is known as Shrove
            Tuesday. Mardi
            Gras is French for "Fat Tuesday", reflecting the practice of the last night of eating rich, fatty foods
            before the
            ritual Lenten sacrifices and fasting of the Lenten season.</p>
        <p>Related popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations before the fasting and religious
            obligations
            associated with the penitential season of Lent. In countries such as the United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is more
            usually
            known as Pancake Daay or (traditionally) Shrove Tuesday (derived from the word shrive, meaning "to administer
            the
            sacrament of confession to; to absolve").</p>

            <p>Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement. It's one big holiday in New Orleans!

                Revelers know to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn themselves with
                long beads caught
                from the floats of previous parades. You'll see a lot of crazy costumes, kids with their families are
                everywhere, and
                both locals and visitors having a great time. Parade goers will sit on the ground, throw balls, play
                music, eat great
                food and watch the crowds walk by between parades. On Mardi Gras day, the majority of non-essential
                businesses are shut
                down because of the celebration.

                Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag with them so they can haul away all the beads and
                trinkets they will
                catch from the parades!

                Every year, we get a lot of questions about how it all begin, and how the traditions have changed. Click

        <h2>Mayor LaToya Cantrell</h2>
        <hr>
        <img class="float-left" src="img/MayorLaToyaCantrell.png" alt="">
        <p>LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New
            Orleans,
            Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before becoming
            mayor, Cantrell
            represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018
            <br>
            Cantrell was re-elected to office by a wide margin in November 2021, securing 65% of the vote. Her campaign
            focused
            on the city's status in 2020 as a COVID-19 hotspot and her efforts, which at times were unpopular, to stop
            the disease's
            spread. She also stressed the need for higher-paying jobs for city workers, better public health outcomes
            and new
            technologies for the future of New Orleans.
            <br>
            Cantrell lives with her husband Jason and daughter RayAnn in New Orleans.
