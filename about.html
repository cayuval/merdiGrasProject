        <h1>The Merdi Grars Festival</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Mardi Gras refers to events of the Carnival celebration, beginning on or after the Christian feasts of
            the Epiphany (Three Kings Day) and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday, which is known as Shrove
            Tuesday. Mardi
            Gras is French for "Fat Tuesday", reflecting the practice of the last night of eating rich, fatty foods
            before the
            ritual Lenten sacrifices and fasting of the Lenten season.</p>
        <p>Related popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations before the fasting and religious
            obligations
            associated with the penitential season of Lent. In countries such as the United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is more
            usually
            known as Pancake Daay or (traditionally) Shrove Tuesday (derived from the word shrive, meaning "to administer
            the
            sacrament of confession to; to absolve").</p>
            <div class="history">
                <h2>Mardi Gras History</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th and 18th
                centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or fatted calf,
                followed France to her colonies.
                <br>
                On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot of ground 60
                miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it was the eve of the
                festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the
                tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.
                <br>
                In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our current Mardi Gras
                krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded from 1711 through 1861. The
                procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with an actual
                bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.
                
                <br>
                New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New Orleans, but not
                with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, established elegant
                society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.
                
                <br>
                The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial governing body. That
                year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and carnival organizations
                formed in New Orleans.
                
                <br>
                By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback riders to celebrate Mardi
                Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and lent each event an exciting air
                of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's
                hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known
                as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.
                <br>
                In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also the first recorded account of
                Mardi Gras "throws."
                <br>
                Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed "Carnival Edition" lithographs of
                parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats were always carefully guarded before
                the procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and details could not be clearly seen. But beginning in 1886
                with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these chromolithographs could be produced in full, saturated color,
                doing justice to the float and costume designs of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these
                designers' work was brought to life by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who for 40 years was
                responsible for creating all of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.
                <br>
                1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside over the first daytime
                parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen introduced Romanoff's family colors of
                purple, green and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for justice; gold for power; and green for faith.
                This was also the Mardi Gras season that Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease to Love," was cemented, due in
                part to the Duke's fondness for the tune.
                <br>
                The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans instead of France, culminating with Comus'
                magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic paper-mache' animal costumes served as
                the basis for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and local officials, including Governor Henry Warmoth. In 1875,
                Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday in Louisiana, which it still is.
                <br>
                Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from private social clubs with
                restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are completely funded by their members, New
                Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"</p>

            <h2>Traditions</h2>
            <hr>
            <img class="float-left" src="img/merdigra13.png" alt="">
            <p>The festival season varies from city to city, as some traditions, such as the one in New Orleans, Louisiana, consider
            Mardi Gras to stretch the entire period from Twelfth Night (the last night of Christmas which begins Epiphany) to Ash
            Wednesday. Others treat the final three-day period before Ash Wednesday as the Mardi Gras. In Mobile, Alabama,
            Mardi Gras–associated social events begin in November, followed by mystic society balls on Thanksgiving,then New
            Year's Eve, followed by parades and balls in January and February, celebrating up to midnight before Ash Wednesday. In
            earlier times, parades were held on New Year's Day. Carnival is an important celebration in Anglican and Catholic
            European nations</p>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Czech Republic
</h3><p>In the Czech Republic, it is a folk tradition to celebrate Mardi Gras, which is called Masopust (meat-fast, i.e.
beginning of the fast there). There are celebrations in many places including Prague, but the tradition also prevails
in villages such as Staré Hamry, whose door-to-door processions made it to the UNESCO World Intangible Cultural Heritage
List</p></li>
                <li><h3>Germany</h3><p>The celebration on the same day in Germany knows many different terms, such as Schmutziger Donnerstag or Fetter
                Donnerstag (Fat Thursday), Unsinniger Donnerstag, Weiberfastnacht, Greesentag and others, and are often only one part of
                the whole carnival events during one or even two weeks before Ash Wednesday be called Karneval, Fasching, or Fastnacht
                among others, depending on the region. In standard German, schmutzig means "dirty", but in the Alemannic dialects
                schmotzig means "lard" (Schmalz), or "fat"; "Greasy Thursday", as remaining winter stores of lard and butter used to
                be consumed at that time, before the fasting began. Fastnacht means "Eve of the Fast", but all three terms cover the
                whole carnival season. The traditional start of the carnival season is on 11 November at 11:11 am (11/11 11:11).</p></li>
                <li><h3>Italy</h3><p>In Italy Mardi Gras is called Martedì Grasso (Fat Tuesday). It is the main day of Carnival along with the Thursday
                before, called Giovedí Grasso (Fat Thursday), which ratifies the start of the celebrations. The most famous Carnivals in
                northern Italy are in Venice, Viareggio and Ivrea, while in the southern part of Italy the Sardinian Sartiglia and the
                intriguing apotropaic masks, especially the mamuthones, issohadores, s'urtzu (and so on), are more popular, belonging to
                a very ancient tradition. Ivrea has the characteristic "Battle of Oranges" that finds its roots in medieval times. The
                Italian version of the festival is spelled Carnevale.</p></li>

        <h2>Mayor LaToya Cantrell</h2>
        <hr>
        <img class="float-left-mayor" src="img/MayorLaToyaCantrell.png" alt="">
        <p>LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New
            Orleans,
            Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before becoming
            mayor, Cantrell
            represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018
            <br>
            Cantrell was re-elected to office by a wide margin in November 2021, securing 65% of the vote. Her campaign
            focused
            on the city's status in 2020 as a COVID-19 hotspot and her efforts, which at times were unpopular, to stop
            the disease's
            spread. She also stressed the need for higher-paying jobs for city workers, better public health outcomes
            and new
            technologies for the future of New Orleans.
            <br>
            Cantrell lives with her husband Jason and daughter RayAnn in New Orleans.
        </p>
        <h3>As Mayor of New Orleans</h3>
        <p>Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's history.[28] Once
        in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic plan to address
        families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with finding solutions to
        violent crime.[29] Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has
        focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and green
        spaces.[30] As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid
        manufacturers and distributors.[31]
        
        During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement with Governor John
        Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million in upfront funding for the city's
        infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the city.[32] Following the approval of the
        Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Mayor Cantrell and the City Council put on the
        ballot in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental properties,
        as well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.</p><br>
        <p>In 2016, Cantrell was given a lifetime achievement award by the presidents of Tulane, Loyola and Xavier universities and
        the University of New Orleans for her service to the community.</p>
