                    <div class="accordion-body">No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs
                        to everyone. Do not believe the claims of
                        businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website.
                        Using the term “official” is
                        just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know better.
                        Products or websites are not
                        licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all
                        of its merchandise. In
                        some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this
                        is not true in New
                        Orleans.</div>

                    <div class="accordion-body">The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast
                        of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday),
                        however, is on a different day each year.
                        <br>
                        Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                        Tuesday is always the
                        day before Ash Wednesday.
                        <br>
                        Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through
                        Ash Wednesday. Check
                        out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.

                        almost hot. Sometimes it will change from one
                        extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a chilly
                        morning may turn into a
                        warm afternoon.
                        <br>
                        Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get
                        somewhat dirty. Don’t
                        forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want to
                        bring a raincoat!

                    <div class="accordion-body">By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family
                        celebration. Those of us who grew up in New
                        Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every parade
                        because we used to use "taking
                        the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff
                        they will catch. Throws
                        often include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.
                        <br>
                        The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass
                        anyway). We recommend
                        seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon since parades can last
                        until 11 p.m. near the end
                        of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family area where you will see
                        many families staking out
                        their parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful
                        oak trees. You don't
                        have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.
                        <br>
                        You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like Metairie,
                        which is only 10 minutes
                        away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend, is the
                        parade Disneyworld
                        features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!
